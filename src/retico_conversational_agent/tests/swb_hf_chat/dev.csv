a a real powerful""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'out of some degree yeah to some degree but uh religion is a factor over there but uh i think the strongest factor is a tribe of the family'},

involved then we're going to be sitting over here freezing in the dark i think uh basically what we're going to have to do is now that Bush has made the made the stand is what we'll have to continue to uh stick up for our foreign policy if we don't then what's going to happen is that everybody well it's just a one time shot they're not going to do anything""}, {'role': 'user', 'content':

""um-hum let's say i'd have to say overall that the the war was was beneficial to the United States with with the change in attitudes and all that you know all that stuff i mean it's oh i don't think we did really either people think better about uh the US now and that's really going to i think eventually come back and and help with overall business standards i mean people are going um take more pride in their work and things like that i think it's going to really help out overall well do you think that um by uh going over there and doing what we did that uh it's going to give us a chance for peace over there""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "" i- i- i agree a hundred percent on that after- after after all you know i mean everything Bush said Bush put down a deadline if if it wasn't

and like Collin Powell and the rest and uh yeah Dick Cheney those people were real smart they're a lot smarter that any body gives credit for""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "" i- i was the person i

'content': 'oh yeah'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""i don't think there's ever going to be peace in in the Middle East it was uh of course he had to fight that to beat microscope anyway""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'um-hum'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""but i hesitate to call it a war since i mean it was i guess it was i'm not used to having them over in six days you know really just kind of gosh we just got started good i guess the Israelis might be over it you know uh you know because they had a seven day war at one time but uh  as long as we do it in a logical manner rather than what we did in Vietnam except jack around with it""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "" i don't think very many people are yeah um-hum""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""although i- i wish instead of turning south you know and- taking a right turn and going down Kuwait City i wished we'd just turned left and gone toward Baghdad""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'yeah there was uh there was a lot of talk about the idea that the even the uh Iraqis themselves the people wished we would have done that uh'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""i think we should have because because we're going- if we don't do it now we're going to have to do it shortly""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'yeah that kind of'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""mostly it it just that that region never had had peace even as far back in biblical times it's never been peaceful ""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""yeah well unless they finally do take care of it themselves but you know you kind of have to wonder whether it's going to be any better with uh you know depending on whether it Shiite Muslim or uh or the Kurds in power but uh you know ""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""but the only thing that'll save that is we won't get the credit for or the blame for the massacre and- and then if we do have to to go back in it will be because you know someone asked us to""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""well that's true too yeah um-hum""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""and of course now's the time to do it because since we have the army over there i'd sure hate to you know spend eight months pulling them out and then turn right around send them back over again""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""um-hum yeah that's true yeah especially the cost of that and- and uh uh the attitudes of the soldiers i mean they're there they- i think they could handle it better but if they came back and then had to turn around and go the attitudes would be just horrible""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""oh yeah they shouldn't leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "" yeah that's probably true""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""they just- you know just- just level the whole place and let it go but we're going to have to be over there and we're and our presence is going to have to be felt and they've got to be strong presidents or presence uh if we don't then i think that we're going to be back there ""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""well that's um-hum""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'you know in the Jimmy Carter- uh Carter era you know wringing your hands and going trust me trust me'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""so do you think it's you do think it's a good idea for us to have uh um-hum""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""you know the Arabs just don't like the Jews and- the Jews don't like the Arabs and then half the Arabs don't like the other Arabs""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""but is i mean is that any different than uh the way it is in even our country i mean uh back in the fifties and forties the blacks didn't like the whites the whites didn't like the blacks but we're getting to the point where we get along pretty good i mean isn't it logical that just any of the- that you can solve differences like that""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""no because you i- i don't think the Mideast has the educational background i- i- i don't think they're later they're rate of literacy is so low that they're still they still have a trouble mentality""}, {'role': 'user',

when they you know have to start you know working and that sort of thing they tend to cut it back to drinking on the weekends or whatever and and they become adults about it and uh in- in fact my

different manner i think it would be a a good source of revenue i think there's some some evidence about the way this stuff has been handled in Europe that shows that it can be controlled in different ways but that's sort of moving off the topic at hand here and i you know the the  it i have to say that i fact of the matter is is i think that issues like this really really are i mean to a certain

right""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""but um so i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday Thursday now that i can just kill two nights and and uh get a reasonable amount of workout in

it's right there and it's they have a really nice facility at the TI they've got two different aerobics rooms they have the mirrors of course sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall

have oh that's great""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""uh-huh and they have ceiling fans in the rooms and it's it's a pretty nice setup um and of course it's real convenient because it is right there
